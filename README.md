# Vé
>From Norse mythology, Vé is the brother of Odin and Vili. The three brothers together slew Ymir, ending the giants' rule. To the first humans, Ask and Embla, Odin gave soul and life; Vili gave wit and sense of touch; and Vé gave countenance, sight, and most importantly, hearing and speech.

Vé is a command-line dictionary tool intended for conlangers. It is written in Go, and stores dictionaries in a SQLite database.

## Planned features:
- Importing and exporting CSV files.
- Multiple dictionaries (for managing multiple conlangs).
- Support for displaying declensions and conjugations.
